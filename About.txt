Project Description 

I designed a fashion store website named "Handii" . It aids the buyer in locating a suitable product on the website(specially handbags). I made the website entirely responsive and included more pages such as a blog, store, and contact-us etc. for various purposes. I'm attempting to tackle a real-world problem, such as finding a decent and authentic product these days. As a result, I created a web application in which I attempted to provide all product information. My project assists customers in receiving things at their doorstep as well as providing genuine stuff.
